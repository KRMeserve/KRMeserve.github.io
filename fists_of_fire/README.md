## Instructions

Fists of Fire is based off of two player arcade-style fighting games. Both players will pick a unique character at the start of the game and fight until one (or both) players have reached 0 health. Where this game differs is that it handles combat through a turn-based system instead of timing based inputs.

This allows for the game to be played locally on the same keyboard without any issues. Player One will control their character with the w, a, s, and d keys while Player Two will control theirs with the i, j, k, and l keys.

A single game will put both players against one another in a best of three situation where the first one to win twice will win the game. Good luck outsmarting your opponent!

### Basic Attacks

All four characters share a few basic attacks that are the core of gameplay.

**Attack**

This is your basic damage dealing ability. It deals increased damage to the opponent if they are healing, but can be countered.

**Counter**

If your opponent attacks you, you take no damage and deal double damage back to them instead. Otherwise, this attack does nothing.

**Heal**

You will heal for 15 health on a successful cast. If this is interrupted by an attack, you will take heavy damage instead.

### Unique Attacks

All four characters have unique special attacks. Each special attack will stun the opponent on the turn it is played (unless both players use their specials at the same time).

**Barbarian**

The Barbarian is a high-damage class that deals 20 unblockable damage to the enemy.

**Priest**

The Priest is - above all - skilled at in holy magic that is focused on healing. Because of this, their special attack deals 5 unblockable damage but heals for 15.

**Knight**

The Knight is a master of melee and damage dealing. The knight does 15 unblockable damage and then raises his shield, increasing health by 5.

**Ranger**

The Ranger likes to stay at a distance and deals 10 unblockable damage and runs to a safer distance, healing for 10.
